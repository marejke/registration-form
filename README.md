# registration-form

# Introduction

This is a registration form developed with **PreactJS**, which I chose over **ReactJS** for this task, to have a quick setup and a small application (and I always wanted to try it out).

# Technical requirements
The registration form contains 5 mandatory input fields for first name, last name, username, password and email.

## Validation rules
* **First Name** - should contain only small and capital letters, no numbers, special characters, etc.
* **Last Name** - same as the First Name
* **Username** - should contain only small letters. May contain also numbers, the "." and "_" characters
* **Password** - should contain anything and should be more than 8 characters in length
* **Email** - must be a valid email address

Clone the repository and can install the app from within the directory with the following command:

```
npm install
```

To start the app, run the following command:

```

```

To run the test, enter the following command in your console:
